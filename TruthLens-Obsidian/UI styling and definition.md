# Lateral Menu

- User Document List
	This either shows a message saying the user needs to sign in to see their history, or show a series of links with previous factchecked statements. Clicking one of these open a reports on the main ui with a summary contating the original media, the final conclusion and main links used as reference.
- Navigation Links
	Contain one item for each of the itens bellow in the Main UI section
- Sign In/Account Status Bar
	Contain one icon for each supported auth method, as for example google, github, facebook and x
# Main UI

- Home
	This is the both the landing and main application view, here, the user will land in page which prompts him to select which media he would like to fact check, an image, audio, or standard text input, which will update the UI accordingly to receive the input. Then, the screen will update to show the step by step of the requested factchecking flow. 
- FAQ & Terms of Service
	The goal here is to have a page making clear both why this app has a solid facthecking method as well as making clear that any large language models produced content must always be checked and never taken at 100% face value.
- Account Management
	Here the user will be able to see his account and most importantly access and manage98 billing and subscription information


# UI breakdown
### Left Sidebar - User History and Navigation:
- **User History**: This section lists the individual fact-checking records. It suggests that the history is personalized, showing a list of fact-checks the user has interacted with or submitted.
- **Sign In Prompt**: When not signed in, users are prompted to log in to view their history. This indicates an authentication-gated area of the app.
- **Additional Links**: Links for 'Docs and FAQ', 'Terms of Service', 'Manage Account', and potentially more, suggest standard user account management and informational resources.
- **Authentication Status**: At the bottom, a toggle or indicator shows whether the user is signed in, and possibly who is signed in if they are.

### Main Content Area - Fact-Checking Feed and Information:
- **App Title**: The main title clearly brands the app and indicates its purpose.
- **Credits**: A small button or link in the top right, possibly for attributions or to access credit purchasing for paid services.
- **Fact-Checking Feed**: The larger central area seems to be reserved for the main functionality of the app â€“ displaying a feed of fact-checking records or possibly live results of AI fact-checking processes.
- **Empty State**: The presence of greyed-out boxes could indicate placeholders for content that will appear once the user is signed in or after they start using the fact-checking feature.

### Design and Layout:
- **Color Scheme**: The use of color might be significant; perhaps purple represents user-related features, and yellow for the main content area.
- **Structure**: The wireframe suggests a clean and organized structure, with a focus on content and ease of navigation.

### UI to Backend Flow Modeling:
From a UI/UX perspective, each element on this wireframe would have corresponding events and data exchanges with the backend:
- **User History**: This would be populated by querying the user's past fact-check submissions or queries from the Firestore database.
- **Sign In/Sign Up**: Initiates the authentication flow with Firebase Authentication. On success, the user's state changes to signed in, and personal history can be fetched.
- **Document Links**: Serve static content or may contain dynamic content based on user interactions and account status.
- **Fact-Checking Feed**: Would dynamically retrieve data from the LLM Pipeline and display real-time or stored fact-checking results.
- **Credits**: May link to a payment flow or a summary of the user's available credits for using premium features.

In the backend, Django would handle session management, authentication status, and requests for fact-check records, while Firebase services would handle user data storage, authentication details, and payment history. HTMX can be used for dynamic loading of the fact-checking feed, and Alpine.js for reactive frontend components.

This wireframe is a foundational step in UI development and will guide the frontend design, ensuring it aligns with the backend functionality and the overall user flow of the application.

# LLM PIPELINE STREAMING UI
### UI Boxes Representing the LLM Pipeline Phases:

1. **Identify Image Type (LLava API Call)**:
   - The first box likely represents the phase where the LLava API is called to identify the type of image submitted by the user.
   - The UI would display the identified image type and possibly a summary or the full image description generated by the LLava API.

2. **Generate WebSearch Plan (GPT-3.5 & Mistral API Calls)**:
   - A subsequent box would be for the phase where the description from LLava is used to generate a bullet-point plan focused on fact-checking. This would involve calls to the GPT-3.5 model and the Mistral API.
   - The UI could show the bullet points as they are generated and allow the user to expand this section for detailed insights into the web search plan.

3. **Execute Web Searches (SerpAPI, NewsAPI, GoogleFactCheck Calls)**:
   - Following boxes may represent the execution of web searches based on the plan. This involves making calls to SerpAPI, NewsAPI, and GoogleFactCheck API.
   - The UI would render these as separate sub-sections within the phase, or as combined results, providing a brief overview that can be expanded to view detailed results from each API. @ just a correction, here, each api call by gpt 3.5 will consist of its separate expandable box/section

4. **Aggregate Information (Mistral API Call)**:
   - The final box in the sequence would represent the aggregation phase where all the information from the searches is compiled into a single document by the Mistral API.
   - The UI might display a summary of the aggregated information, with an option for the user to expand and read the full document.

### User Interaction with the UI:

- Users can interact with each box representing a phase to get real-time updates on the progress of the fact-checking operation.
- Clicking on a yellow bar (or other designated UI element) will expand the box, revealing more detailed information about what the LLM has done in that phase.
- The detailed view may include the output from the APIs, such as the image type, the bullet-point plan, search results, news articles, and the final aggregated fact-check report.
- Users can likely navigate through the phases to review the process, understand the rationale behind the fact-checking, and verify the sources used.

### Backend Considerations:

- Backend processes must handle real-time updates to the frontend as each phase of the LLM pipeline progresses.
- The system should be designed to handle asynchronous calls and responses, ensuring that the UI reflects the current state of the pipeline effectively.
- State management will be crucial, possibly using a combination of frontend frameworks (like Alpine.js) and backend services (like Firebase and Django channels) to keep the UI in sync with the backend processes.

This comprehensive system aims to provide transparency and clarity to users about the fact-checking process, enabling them to see the progression of their query through the pipeline and access in-depth information as needed.
