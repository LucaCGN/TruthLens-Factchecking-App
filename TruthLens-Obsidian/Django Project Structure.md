### Comprehensive Explanation of the Project Structure

The `truth_lens_project` folder is the root directory of the Django project. It contains the `manage.py` script, which is a command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways.

Within the root directory, there are several Django apps, each representing a functional component of the project:

- **user_auth**: This app is dedicated to user authentication. It uses Firebase Authentication to sign users in and manage user sessions. It contains all necessary views, forms, and templates required for user authentication and account management processes.

- **fact_checking**: Here lies the core of the application logic for fact-checking. It interacts with Firestore to store and retrieve fact-checking records and manages the user's interactions with the fact-checking system. It also

 contains the asynchronous tasks that integrate with the LLM pipeline through various API calls.

- **static_pages**: This app provides static content such as FAQs and Terms of Service. It is generally independent of the other apps and primarily delivers informational content to the user.

- **billing**: This app manages all billing and subscription processes. It integrates with Stripe for payment processing and maintains records of transactions and subscription statuses within Django models.

- **pipeline**: This app handles the operation of the LLM pipeline, managing the sequence of external API calls necessary for the fact-checking process. It also contains utility functions that aid in processing and analyzing the data.

- **firebase_integration**: This directory includes the setup for Firebase services, including initialization of the Firebase admin SDK and service functions for Firestore and Firebase Cloud Storage.

In the `static` directory, you'll find all the static assets like JavaScript files (including Alpine.js and HTMX for frontend interactivity) and CSS for styling.

The `templates` directory contains the global templates (`base.html` and `navbar.html`) that provide a common structure and navigation bar for all pages across the application.

Finally, the `truth_lens_project` directory includes settings, configurations, and WSGI information necessary to deploy and run the Django project.

This structure aims to encapsulate functionality within discrete apps, promoting modular development and making it easier to maintain and scale the application. The separation of concerns allows different teams or developers to work on separate parts of the project without causing conflicts, and it streamlines the development process by clearly defining where each piece of logic should reside.
